# foreclojure

A collection of my solutions and other musings around [4clojure](http://4clojure.com).

## ClojureScript

Built with [figwheel](http://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) and [nREPL for a cljs repl](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Using-the-Figwheel-REPL-within-NRepl).  Steps to start:

    (use 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api)
    (start-figwheel!)
    (cljs-repl)
